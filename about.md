<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an experienced Audio Engineer and Sound Designer with a demonstrated history of working in professional environments.</p>

<p>I am a firm believer in collaboration and asking questions. There are many different sides to a project, so strong communication skills are necessary for ends to properly meet. In order to achieve greatness and go above-and-beyond, I ask questions and make sure my teammates understand what is going on at all times. Nobody should be left behind, and everybody should give it their all.</p>
